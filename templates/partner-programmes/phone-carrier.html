		<h1>Phone carriers</h1>
		<p>Ubuntu comes to phones with the specific needs of network operators, OEMs and ODMs in mind. It offers great performance on handsets with a low bill of materials, while opening up new opportunities for phone and PC convergence at the top end of the market. And there are many ways in which the user experience can be tailored to your brand.</p>
		<p>Ubuntu is driving change in the mobile industry by delivering what matters to device manufacturers and operators &mdash; the only platform which allows ownership of the service layer, enabling unprecedented differentiation and revenue sharing opportunities.</p>
