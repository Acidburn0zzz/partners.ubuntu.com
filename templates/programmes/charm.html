      <h2>The power of charms</h2>
      <p>Juju lets you model, integrate and scale applications quickly and easily.
      By creating a Juju charm for your product, you make it easy for administrators
      and devops teams to integrate it with hundreds of other solutions.</p>
      <p>Charms are sets of scripts that simplify the deployment and management
      tasks of specific services. They can be written in any language and leverage
      configuration management tools. Once a Charm has been created by your developers,
      anyone can use it to unleash the full power of your software.</p>
      <p>The Juju Charm Store has over 300 applications ready to use today. They
      can even be combined in Bundles. If your application is commonly deployed
      with other services (as most are) a customer can use a Charm Bundle to deploy
      all the services together, wherever they need to run.</p>
