      <h2 class="p-heading--three">App developer partners</h2>
      <p>Snaps are applications packaged with all their dependencies to run on all popular Linux distributions from a single build. They update automatically and roll back gracefully. Whether youâ€™re building for desktop, cloud, or the Internet of Things, publishing as a snap will keep users up to date and make system configuration issues less likely, freeing you to code more and debug less.</p>
      <p>Snapcraft, the open source tool to publish snaps, picks up from your existing build artefacts or language of choice, be it Python, Go, C/C++, Node.js, or even .NET. With 20 minutes you can have your first app built and released in the Snap Store.</p>
